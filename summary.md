### Summary:

This dashboard provides a holistic view of the global sales performance of a fashion retail brand across years, countries, cities, and customer segments. With a peak in 2024 and a subsequent decline in 2025, the focus must shift to diagnosing and addressing this sales dip. Asia, especially cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai, dominates the revenue landscape, with key customer loyalty and preference for premium categories.

The dominance of credit card payments signals a mature, digitally fluent customer base. Sub-category analysis indicates product lines like Coats and Blazers are revenue drivers. Strategic decisions on geographical focus, product portfolio refinement, and enhanced customer engagement will be critical for reversing the sales downturn in 2025 and ensuring sustainable growth.

Additionally, discount impact analysis reveals that the highest sales figures were generated with minimal or no discounting, suggesting that perceived value and brand strength are key purchase drivers. This provides an opportunity to reinforce premium positioning and reduce reliance on discount-led promotions. It also highlights the importance of maintaining brand equity while avoiding excessive markdown strategies.

Furthermore, performance disparities across regions and stores suggest an urgent need for localization of inventory, marketing, and customer experience strategies. The underperformance of stores in Europe contrasts with Asia’s strength, reinforcing the case for market-specific strategies. By leveraging data-driven insights, the company can prioritize high-yield markets, streamline operations in lagging areas, and drive long-term profitability through informed decisions.
